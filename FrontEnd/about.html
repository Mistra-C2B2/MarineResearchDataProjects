<h2 class="info-header">The C2B2-relevant list of research projects</h2>
<p>Release version: v2025b.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
This project list has been compiled as part of <a href="https://c2b2.se">Mistra Co-Creating Better Blue (C2B2)</a>, Task 2.5 Marine data stewardship - FAIR and Open data management and integration into existing aggregators.</p>

<p>C2B2 envisions a more sustainable, open and democratic, multi-sector and multi-actor blue economy and sustainable society.</p>

<p>The generation of new data sources about the ocean and their combination with existing data is accelerating the need to coordinate, integrate and soundly manage such data using the FAIR data principles. Yet many research institutions and/or groups collecting marine data are too small to afford a Data Steward. All Swedish universities can obtain advice on data management from <a href="https://snd.se/en">Swedish National Data service, SND</a>, but subject- specific support to ensure the availability of marine data is not yet available and there is no direct support yet with file management, which in many cases is needed to maximize data utilization. </p>

<p>This task will monitor and support C2B2 and other projects that collect marine research data. This will ensure that new data streams will be integrated into major existing data environments (such as <a href="https://www.copernicus.eu/en">Copernicus</a>) in order to maximize their uptake and utilization. </p>

<p>The first step in this process is creating an inventory to keep track of past, running and new projects that collect marine data. The PIs of these projects will be contacted to find out what data is being collected, and to inform them about open data and requirements from  funders, infrastructures' open data policies, and relevant legislative frameworks. C2B2 till be available to help them with their data management plan, and during the project lifetime to help them publish their data according to the FAIR data principles.</p>


<h3>The C2B2-relevant list of research projects</h3>

<p>Information about marine research projects has been sourced from the <a href="https://www.vr.se/english/swecris.html#/">Swecris national research project database</a> for participating research funding bodies that have distributed their funds to researchers in Sweden. The database contains data from both governmental and private research funding bodies. Information was obtained from <a href="https://swecris-api.vr.se/index.html">the Swecris public API</a>. </p>
<p>The Swecris fields shown in the catalog are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>projectTitleSv: The title of the project in Swedish.</li>
  <li>projectTitleEn: The title of the project in English.</li>
  <li>projectID: The id of the project.</li>
  <li>coordinatingOrganisationNameSv: The name of the coordinating organisation in Swedish.</li>
  <li>coordinatingOrganisationNameEn: The name of the coordinating organisation in English.</li>
  <li>fundingStartDate: The funding start date.</li>
  <li>fundingEndDate: The funding end date.</li>
  <li>projectAbstractSv: The abstract of the project in Swedish.</li>
  <li>projectAbstractEn: The abstract of the project in English.</li>
  <li>fundingOrganisationNameSv: The name of the funding organisation in Swedish.</li>
  <li>fundingOrganisationNameEn: The name of the funding organisation in English.</li>
  <li>scbs: SCB classification level 5 according to <a href=https://www.scb.se/dokumentation/klassifikationer-och-standarder/standard-for-svensk-indelning-av-forskningsamnen/>Standard för svensk indelning av forskningsämnen 2011</a>
</ul>

<p>Initial project selection was a combination of text-based and subject based searches, followed by subjective assessment of the relevance of the project for C2B2. Project selection was restricted to projects funded in the years 2019-2025 inclusive. A summary of the search terms used to retrieve project data from Swecris is provided in the <a href="https://gitlab.com/t2.5/MarineResearchDataProjects/-/raw/main/ManualSearch/search_summary.md?ref_type=heads">search_summary.md</a> file on GitLab.</p>

<p>Interesting projects were then selected manually from the query results as those that appear to be collecting data or developing models that could be of use to C2B2 Living Labs (LLs). This is a much smaller set of projects than those for which the project results (eg books, reports) could be of interest to the LLs. For list Version 1, the objective of this activity was to identify research projects which may be collecting relevant data, but where there is a risk that the data does not become accessible. Projects that might be relevant to particular LL actors but which lacked a clear geographic  connection to the LLs (eg research on marine propulsion or wind turbines) were not selected. The goal of selecting projects was expanded for the 2025 list update to include any project that migth generate outputs of interest to the LLs.</p>

<p>A list of all projects selected by the search algorithms, and then manually evaluated is provided in the 
<a href="https://gitlab.com/t2.5/MarineResearchDataProjects/-/raw/main/ManualSearch/master_list.csv?ref_type=heads">master_list.csv</a> file on GitLab.</p>

<p>All codes used in the list selection are provided on the <a href="https://gitlab.com/t2.5/MarineResearchDataProjects">GitLab MarineResearchDataProjects repository</a>.</p>
